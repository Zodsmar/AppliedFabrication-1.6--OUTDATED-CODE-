AppliedFabrication
==================

Anything to do with Automation and the creation of an item from another item!

To create a test .jar download the src(master) and go into cmd
Locate to folder with the build.xml (AppliedFabrication/build.xml)

Navigate to it using cd (the directory)

Once in the directory run ant (you need Ant Apache installed to do this) and your jar will be made! Find the .jar in releases! 

That's it!

Read LICENSE.md for copyright and all that jazz!
